## Data Cleaning and Processing

(Describe the steps in data cleaning)

```{r}

    "data/significant-volcanic-eruption-database.csv", 
    sep = ";", na.strings=c("", NA)) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    -c(month, day, location, status, volcano_missing, volcano_missing_description, earthquakes_houses_damaged_description),
    -starts_with("total")
    ) |>
  mutate( # change flags to boolean
    flag_tsunami = case_match(flag_tsunami, "Tsunami"~ TRUE, NA ~ FALSE),
    flag_earthquake = case_match(flag_earthquake, "Earthquake"~ TRUE, NA ~ FALSE)
  ) |>
  separate(coordinates, into = c("lat", "long"), sep = ",") |>
  mutate(
    lat = as.numeric(lat), long = as.numeric(long)
  ) |>
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with('description')), ~ifelse(is.na(.), "None/No Record", .)) |>
  mutate( # correct injuries description
    volcano_injuries_description = case_match(
      volcano_injuries_description,
      "Very Many (~1001 or more deaths)" ~ "Very Many (~1001 or more injuries)", 
      "Many (~101 to 1000 deaths)" ~ "Many (~101 to 1000 injuries)", 
      "Some (~51 to 100 deaths)" ~ "Some (~51 to 100 injuries)", 
      "Few (~1 to 50 deaths)" ~ "Few (~1 to 50 injuries)",
      "None/No Record" ~ "None/No Record"
    )
  ) |>
  mutate( # change descriptions to factors w/ levels
    volcano_deaths_description = factor(volcano_deaths_description, levels = c("Very Many (~1001 or more deaths)", "Many (~101 to 1000 deaths)", "Some (~51 to 100 deaths)", "Few (~1 to 50 deaths)", "None/No Record")),
    volcano_injuries_description = factor(volcano_injuries_description, levels = c("Very Many (~1001 or more injuries)", "Many (~101 to 1000 injuries)", "Some (~51 to 100 injuries)", "Few (~1 to 50 injuries)", "None/No Record")),
    volcano_damage_description = factor(volcano_damage_description, levels = c("EXTREME (~$25 million or more)", "SEVERE (~>$5 to $24 million)", "MODERATE (~$1 to $5 million)", "LIMITED (roughly corresponding to less than $1 million)", "None/No Record")),
    volcano_houses_destroyed_description = factor(volcano_houses_destroyed_description, levels = c("Very Many (~1001 or more houses)", "Many (~101 to 1000 houses)", "Some (~51 to 100 houses)", "Few (~1 to 50 houses)", "None/No Record"))
  )

```

The final dataset used in the analysis has the following key variables:

* `year`: the year of eruption
* `flag_tsunami`: specifies whether there is a tsunami accompanying the volcanic eruption (1: with tsunami, 0: no tsunami)
* `flag_earthquake`: specifies whether there is an earthquake accompanying the volcanic eruption (1: with earthquake, 0: no earthquake)
* `volcano_name`: the name of the volcano
* `country`: the country where the volcano is located
* `elevation`: the elevation of the volcano
* `volcano_type`: the type of the volcano
* `volcanic_explosivity_index`          
* `volcano_deaths`                      
* `volcano_deaths_description`         
* `volcano_injuries`                    
* `volcano_injuries_description`       
* `volcano_damage_in_m`                
* `volcano_damage_description`         
* `volcano_houses_destroyed`             
* `volcano_houses_destroyed_description`
* `lat`                                 
* `long`


## Geographical Distribution of Volcanic Eruptions

First, we want to figure out which countries or regions are most prone to volcanic eruptions, so we make an interactive map to display the geographical distribution of volcanoes.

```{r}
geo_df = 
  tidy_df |>
  select(volcano_name, country, volcano_type, elevation, lat, long) |>
  group_by(volcano_name, country, volcano_type, elevation, lat, long) |>
  summarise(eruption_count = n())

geo_df |>
  filter(eruption_count >= 2) |>
  leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
  addMarkers(lat = ~lat, 
             lng = ~long, 
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             label = ~paste(
               "Name: ", volcano_name, "<br>",
               "Country: ", country, "<br>",
               "Volcano Type: ", volcano_type, "<br>",
               "Elevation: ", elevation, "<br>",
               "Eruption Count: ", eruption_count) |> lapply(htmltools::HTML)) 
```

We can notice that most volcanoes are located at the edge of the continents. This pattern is a result of the tectonic plate boundaries where volcanic activity is often concentrated. 

```{r}
country1 =
  geo_df |>
  group_by(country)|>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(5) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, -n), y = n, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Top Five Countries with the Most Volcanoes",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Number of Volcanoes") 


country2 =
  geo_df |>
  group_by(country)|>
  summarise(n = sum(eruption_count)) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(5) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, -n), y = n, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Top Five Countries with the Most Volcanic Eruptions",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Number of Eruptions") 

plot_grid(country1, country2, ncol = 1)
```

The top five countries with the most volcanoes are: Indonesia, Japan, United States, Papua New Guinea and Russia.  
The top five countries with the most volcanic eruptions are: Indonesia, Japan, Italy, Iceland and United States.

## The Factors Influencing Casualties and Property Losses Caused by Volcanic Activity(numeric)

In this section, we aim to explore the impact of various factors(the occurrence of tsunami and earthquake, the type of volcano and the volcanic explosivity index) on casualties and property losses resulting from volcanic eruptions.

### Tidy Data

```{r}
numeric_df = 
  tidy_df |> 
  select(year,flag_tsunami,flag_earthquake,
         volcano_type, volcanic_explosivity_index,

  mutate(
    flag_tsunami = factor(flag_tsunami),
    flag_earthquake = factor(flag_earthquake),
    volcanic_explosivity_index = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index))
```

We can see that in general, for volcanic eruptions with casualties and damages, the occurrence of tsunami and earthquakes will increase the severity of the losses.

### VEI

```{r VEI deaths}
cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_deaths_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), fill = volcano_deaths_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Casualty Levels for Eruptions with Deaths",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r VEI injuries}
cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_injuries_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), fill = volcano_injuries_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Casualty Levels for Eruptions with Injuries",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r VEI damages}
cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_damage_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), fill = volcano_damage_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Casualty Levels for Eruptions with Damages",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r VEI houses destroyed}
cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_houses_destroyed_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), 
    fill = volcano_houses_destroyed_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Casualty Levels for Eruptions with Houses Destroyed",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

We can see that as VEI increases, the proportion of volcanic eruptions with more severe losses also increases, especially for casualty levels. This indicates that eruptions with a large VEI is likely to be more deadly.
