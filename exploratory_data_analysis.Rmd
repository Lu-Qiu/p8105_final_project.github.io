  )

write.csv(tidy_df, "data/volcanic-eruption-final.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

The final dataset used in the analysis has the following key variables:

* `year`: the year of eruption
* `flag_tsunami`: specifies whether there is a tsunami accompanying the volcanic eruption (1: with tsunami, 0: no tsunami)
* `flag_earthquake`: specifies whether there is an earthquake accompanying the volcanic eruption (1: with earthquake, 0: no earthquake)
* `volcano_name`: the name of the volcano
* `country`: the country where the volcano is located
* `elevation`: the elevation of the volcano
* `volcano_type`: the type of the volcano
* `volcanic_explosivity_index`: volcanic explosivity index of the eruption         
* `volcano_deaths`: deaths caused directly by volcanic eruption                      
* `volcano_deaths_description`: description of deaths caused directly by volcanic eruption          
* `volcano_injuries`: injuries caused directly by volcanic eruption                    
* `volcano_injuries_description`: description of injuries caused directly by volcanic eruption       
* `volcano_damage_in_m`: damage (in million dollars) caused directly by volcanic eruption  
* `volcano_damage_description`: description of damage (in million dollars) caused directly by volcanic eruption         
* `volcano_houses_destroyed`: houses destroyed directly by volcanic eruption             
* `volcano_houses_destroyed_description`: description of houses destroyed directly by volcanic eruption
* `lat`: latitude                                
* `long`: longitude


## Geographical Distribution of Volcanic Eruptions

First, we want to figure out which countries or regions are most prone to volcanic eruptions, so we make an interactive map to display the geographical distribution of volcanoes.

```{r}
geo_df = 
  tidy_df |>
  select(volcano_name, country, volcano_type, elevation, lat, long) |>
  group_by(volcano_name, country, volcano_type, elevation, lat, long) |>
  summarise(eruption_count = n())

geo_df |>
  filter(eruption_count >= 2) |>
  leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) |>
  addMarkers(lat = ~lat, 
             lng = ~long, 
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
             label = ~paste(
               "Name: ", volcano_name, "<br>",
               "Country: ", country, "<br>",
               "Volcano Type: ", volcano_type, "<br>",
               "Elevation: ", elevation, "<br>",
               "Eruption Count: ", eruption_count) |> lapply(htmltools::HTML)) 
```

We can notice that most volcanoes are located at the edge of the continents. This pattern is a result of the tectonic plate boundaries where volcanic activity is often concentrated. 

```{r}
country1 =
  geo_df |>
  group_by(country)|>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(5) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, -n), y = n, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Top Five Countries with the Most Volcanoes",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Number of Volcanoes") 


country2 =
  geo_df |>
  group_by(country)|>
  summarise(n = sum(eruption_count)) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(5) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, -n), y = n, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Top Five Countries with the Most Volcanic Eruptions",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Number of Eruptions") 

plot_grid(country1, country2, ncol = 1)
```

The top five countries with the most volcanoes are: Indonesia, Japan, United States, Papua New Guinea and Russia.  
The top five countries with the most volcanic eruptions are: Indonesia, Japan, Italy, Iceland and United States.

## Time Distribution of Volcanic Eruptions

```{r}
# Tidy data for plotting
voc_year <- tidy_df%>%
  group_by(year,volcanic_explosivity_index)%>%
  summarise(count = n())

voc_year$period <- ifelse(voc_year$year < 0, "Before Christ",
ifelse(voc_year$year <= 1000, "0-1000",
ifelse(voc_year$year <= 1500, "1000-1500",
ifelse(voc_year$year <= 1899, "1500-1900",
ifelse(tidy_df$year <= 1999, "20th century", "21st century"))))) 

# Change the variable type to factor
voc_year$period <- factor(voc_year$period, levels = c("Before Christ", "0-1000", "1000-1500", "1500-1900", "20th century","21st century"))
```

### Volcanic Eruption Counts Over Periods

```{r}
expo <- voc_year |>
  select(period,volcanic_explosivity_index) |>
  group_by(period,volcanic_explosivity_index) |>
  summarise(count = n())

# Plotting
ggplot(expo,aes(x = period, y = count,fill = volcanic_explosivity_index)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="stack") +
   labs(
    x = "Period",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Volcanic Explosivity Index Count Over Periods"
  )
```


### Analysis of Deaths and Injuries Over Time
```{r}
time_df <- tidy_df |>
  filter(year > 1900) |>
  mutate(
    volcano_deaths = replace(volcano_deaths, is.na(volcano_deaths), 0),
    volcano_injuries = replace(volcano_injuries, is.na(volcano_injuries), 0),
    volcano_damage_in_m = replace(volcano_damage_in_m, is.na(volcano_damage_in_m), 0),
    volcano_houses_destroyed = replace(volcano_houses_destroyed, is.na(volcano_houses_destroyed), 0),
    year = as.character(year)
  ) |>
group_by(year) |>
  summarize(
    total_deaths = sum(volcano_deaths,na.rm = TRUE),
    total_injuries = sum(volcano_injuries,na.rm = TRUE),
    total_damage = sum(volcano_damage_in_m,na.rm = TRUE),
    total_house_destruction = sum(volcano_houses_destroyed,na.rm = TRUE)
  )


ggplot(time_df, aes(x = as.numeric(year))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_deaths, color = "Deaths"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_injuries, color = "Injuries"), size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Analysis of Toal Deaths and Total Injuries Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count",
    color = "Variable"
  )
```

### Analysis of Damage and Houses Destroyed Over Time
```{r}
ggplot(time_df, aes(x = as.numeric(year))) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_damage, color = "Damage"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_house_destruction, color = "Houses Destroyed"), size = 1)+
  labs(
    title = "Analysis of Damage and Houses Destroyed Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Count",
    color = "Variable"
  ) 
```

## Factors Influencing Volcanic Losses (Numeric)

In this section, we aim to explore the impact of various factors(the occurrence of tsunami and earthquake, the type of volcano and the volcanic explosivity index) on casualties and property losses resulting from volcanic eruptions.

```{r}
numeric_df = 
  tidy_df |> 
  select(year,flag_tsunami,flag_earthquake,
         volcano_type, volcanic_explosivity_index,
         volcano_injuries, volcano_deaths, volcano_damage_in_m, volcano_houses_destroyed) |>
  mutate(
    flag_tsunami = factor(flag_tsunami),
    flag_earthquake = factor(flag_earthquake),
    volcanic_explosivity_index = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index))
```

### Tsunami 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# volcano_injuries vs flag_tsunami 
tsunami_injuries = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_injuries)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_tsunami, y = log(volcano_injuries), group = flag_tsunami, fill = flag_tsunami)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Injuries vs Tsunami", x = "Tsunami Occurrence", y = "ln_Injuries")


# volcano_deaths vs flag_tsunami
tsunami_deaths = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_deaths)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_tsunami, y = log(volcano_deaths), group = flag_tsunami, fill = flag_tsunami)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Deaths vs Tsunami", x = "Tsunami Occurrence", y = "ln_Deaths") 


# damage vs flag_tsunami
tsunami_damage = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_damage_in_m)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_tsunami, y = log(volcano_damage_in_m), group = flag_tsunami, fill = flag_tsunami)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Damage vs Tsunami", x = "Tsunami Occurrence", y = "ln_Damage(money in million)") 


# volcano_houses_destroyed vs flag_tsunami 
tsunami_houses_destroyed = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_houses_destroyed)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_tsunami, y = log(volcano_houses_destroyed), group = flag_tsunami, fill = flag_tsunami)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed vs Tsunami", x = "Tsunami Occurrence", y = "ln_Houses Destroyed")

grid.arrange(tsunami_injuries, tsunami_deaths, tsunami_damage, tsunami_houses_destroyed, ncol = 2)
```

The box plots above indicate a noticeable influence of tsunami occurrence on the volcanic losses. The tsunami effects triggered by volcanic activities are likely to contribute to an increase in both casualties and property damage.

### Earthquake 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# volcano_injuries vs flag_earthquake
earthquake_injuries = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_injuries)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, y = log(volcano_injuries), group = flag_earthquake, fill = flag_earthquake)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Injuries vs Earthquake", x = "Earthquake Occurrence", y = "ln_Injuries") 


#volcano_deaths vs flag_earthquake
earthquake_deaths = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_deaths)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, y = log(volcano_deaths), group = flag_earthquake, fill = flag_earthquake)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Deaths vs Earthquake", x = "Earthquake Occurrence", y = "ln_Deaths")


#damage vs flag_earthquake 
earthquake_damage = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_damage_in_m)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, y = log(volcano_damage_in_m), group = flag_earthquake, fill = flag_earthquake)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Damage vs Earthquake", x = "Earthquake Occurrence", y = "ln_Damage(money in million)") 


#volcano_houses_destroyed vs flag_earthquake
earthquake_houses_destroyed = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_houses_destroyed)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, y = log(volcano_houses_destroyed), group = flag_earthquake,fill = flag_earthquake)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed vs Earthquake", x = "Earthquake Occurrence", y = "ln_Houses Destroyed") 


grid.arrange(earthquake_injuries, earthquake_deaths, earthquake_damage, earthquake_houses_destroyed, ncol = 2)
```

The above box plots indicate that when volcanic eruptions trigger volcanic earthquakes, there is a generally noticeable increase in casualties and property damage compared to situations where volcanic earthquakes are not triggered.

### Volcano Type 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# volcano_injuries vs volcano_type
type_injuries =
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_injuries)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(volcano_type, volcano_injuries, median), y = log(volcano_injuries), group = volcano_type, fill = volcano_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Injuries vs Volcano Type", x = "Volcano Type", y = "ln_Injuries") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none")


# volcano_deaths vs volcano_type
type_deaths = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_deaths)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(volcano_type, volcano_deaths, median), y = log(volcano_deaths), group = volcano_type, fill = volcano_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Deaths vs Volcano Type", x = "Volcano Type", y = "ln_Deaths")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none")


# damage vs volcano_type
type_damage =
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_damage_in_m)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(volcano_type, volcano_damage_in_m, median), y = log(volcano_damage_in_m), group = volcano_type, fill = volcano_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Damage vs Volcano Type", x = "Volcano Type", y = "ln_Damage")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none")


# volcano_houses_destroyed vs volcano_type
type_houses_destroyed =
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_houses_destroyed)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(volcano_type, volcano_houses_destroyed, median), y = log(volcano_houses_destroyed), group = volcano_type, fill = volcano_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed vs Volcano Type", x = "Volcano Type", y = "ln_Houses Destroyed")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(type_injuries, type_deaths, type_damage, type_houses_destroyed, ncol = 2)
```


* The above box plots indicate that there is no clear correlation between the types of volcanoes and the volcanic losses. Some volcanoes that result in significant property damage during eruptions do not necessarily lead to a high number of casualties (which may be related to missing values).
* Among these volcanoes, eruptions of the "Maar" type lead to the most severe casualties, while eruptions of the "Stratovolcano" type comparatively result in more substantial property damage.

### VEI 

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

# volcano_injuries vs VEI
VEI_injuries = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_injuries),
         !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = volcanic_explosivity_index, y = log(volcano_injuries), group = volcanic_explosivity_index, fill = volcanic_explosivity_index)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Injuries vs VEI", x = "VEI (level)", y = "ln_Injuries")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


# volcano_deaths vs VEI
VEI_deaths = 
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_deaths),
         !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = volcanic_explosivity_index, y = log(volcano_deaths), group = volcanic_explosivity_index, fill = volcanic_explosivity_index)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Deaths vs VEI", x = "VEI (level)", y = "ln_Deaths")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


# damage vs VEI 
VEI_damage =
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_damage_in_m),
         !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = volcanic_explosivity_index, y = log(volcano_damage_in_m), group = volcanic_explosivity_index, fill = volcanic_explosivity_index)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Damage vs VEI", x = "VEI (level)", y = "ln_Damage") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


# volcano_houses_destroyed vs VEI
VEI_houses_destroyed =
  numeric_df |>
  filter(!is.na(volcano_houses_destroyed),
         !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = volcanic_explosivity_index, y = log(volcano_houses_destroyed), group = volcanic_explosivity_index, fill = volcanic_explosivity_index)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed vs VEI", x = "VEI (level)", y = "ln_Houses Destroyed") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


grid.arrange(VEI_injuries, VEI_deaths, VEI_damage, VEI_houses_destroyed, ncol = 2)
```

The above box plots show that with the increase in the volcanic explosivity index, there is a general upward trend in casualties and property damage caused by volcanic eruptions. In other words, as the energy of the volcanic eruption increases, the casualties and losses become more severe.

-------------------

## Factors Influencing Volcanic Losses (Descriptive)

Using bar charts, we can take a look at the severity levels of casualties and damages from volcanic eruptions with different factors involved.

Considering the problem with missing data and our interest of study, we will filter out the "None/No Record" values when examining loss levels and focus on the observations with losses recorded.

```{r}
cad_df = tidy_df |>
  select(year, flag_tsunami, flag_earthquake,
         volcano_type, volcanic_explosivity_index, 
         volcano_deaths_description, volcano_injuries_description,
         volcano_damage_description, volcano_houses_destroyed_description,
         volcano_deaths, volcano_injuries, 
         volcano_damage_in_m, volcano_houses_destroyed,
         elevation)
```

  arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 1), 
  mylegends, 
  nrow = 2, heights=c(10, 3))
```

We can see that in general, for volcanic eruptions with casualties and damages, the occurrence of tsunami will increase the severity of the losses.

### Earthquake

```{r earthquake losses}
p1 = cad_df|>
  filter(volcano_deaths_description != "None/No Record") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, fill = volcano_deaths_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Deaths",
       x = "Earthquake",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 = cad_df|>
  filter(volcano_injuries_description != "None/No Record") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, fill = volcano_injuries_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Injuries",
       x = "Earthquake",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p3 = cad_df|>
  filter(volcano_damage_description != "None/No Record") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, fill = volcano_damage_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Damages",
       x = "Earthquake",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p4 = cad_df|>
  filter(volcano_houses_destroyed_description != "None/No Record") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flag_earthquake, fill = volcano_houses_destroyed_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed",
       x = "Earthquake",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

#### Severity of Losses vs Earthquake

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

#grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2)
grid.arrange(
  arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 1), 
  mylegends, 
  nrow = 2, heights=c(10, 3))
```

We can see that in general, for volcanic eruptions with casualties and damages, the occurrence of earthquakes will increase the severity of the losses.


----------------------

### VEI

```{r VEI losses}
p1 = cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_deaths_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), fill = volcano_deaths_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Deaths",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 = cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_injuries_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), fill = volcano_injuries_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Injuries",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p3 = cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_damage_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), fill = volcano_damage_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Damages",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p4 = cad_df|>
  filter(
    volcano_houses_destroyed_description != "None/No Record",
    !is.na(volcanic_explosivity_index)
    ) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index), 
    fill = volcano_houses_destroyed_description)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Severity of Losses vs VEI

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

grid.arrange(
  arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2), 
  mylegends, 
  nrow = 2, heights=c(10, 3))
```

We can see that as VEI increases, the proportion of volcanic eruptions with more severe losses also increases, especially for casualty levels. This indicates that eruptions with a large VEI is likely to be more deadly.


----------------------

### Elevation

```{r elevation losses}
elv_df = cad_df|>
  filter(!is.na(elevation)) |>
  mutate(
    height = ifelse(elevation < 0, "< 0",
      ifelse(elevation <= 1000, "0-1000",
        ifelse(elevation <= 2000, "1000-2000",
          ifelse(elevation <= 3000, "2000-3000",
            ifelse(elevation <= 4000, "3000-4000",
              ifelse(elevation <= 5000, "4000-5000", "> 5000")))))) ) |>
  mutate(height = factor(height, levels = c("< 0", "0-1000", "1000-2000", "2000-3000", "3000-4000", "4000-5000", "> 5000")))


p1 = elv_df |>
  filter(
    volcano_deaths_description != "None/No Record",
    ) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = height, fill = volcano_deaths_description)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count", position = "fill") +
  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +

  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +

       x = "Elevation (m)",
       y = "Proportion") +

  geom_text(stat = "count",
            aes(label = ..count..),
            position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Damages",
       x = "Elevation (m)",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +

  labs(title = "Houses Destroyed",
       x = "Elevation (m)",
       y = "Proportion") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

#### Severity of Losses vs Elevation

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

grid.arrange(
  arrangeGrob(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2), 
  mylegends, 
  nrow = 2, heights=c(10, 3))
```

From the bar charts, there don't seem to be a significant association between the severity of volcanic losses and the elevation of the volcano.

## Iceland Volcanic Activity Analysis

```{r}
iceland_volcanic_data <- tidy_df %>%
  filter(country == "Iceland")

ggplot(iceland_volcanic_data, aes(x = year, fill = as.factor(-year))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "darkgray") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(title = "Plot 1: Distribution of Volcanic Eruptions in Iceland Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Eruptions")

```

Plot 1 shows the number of volcanic eruptions in Iceland over several centuries. The data suggests an increase in recorded eruptions over time, particularly around the late 1700s. However the increasing trend in later years could be attributed to better documentation as well as an actual increase in volcanic activity.

```{r}
iceland_volcanic_data %>%
  count(volcano_type) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  mutate(volcano_type = factor(volcano_type, levels = volcano_type)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = volcano_type, y = n, fill = volcano_type)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Plot 2: Prevalence of Different Volcano Types in Iceland",
       x = "Volcano Type",
       y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Plot 2 indicates that stratovolcanoes are the most prevalent volcano type in Iceland, suggesting varied and complex volcanic activity.

```{r}
iceland_volcanic_data |>
  mutate(VEI = factor(volcanic_explosivity_index, levels = 1:6)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = VEI, fill = fct_rev(VEI))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value = "gray")+
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Plot 3: Distribution of Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) in Iceland",
       x = "VEI",
       y = "Count")

```

Plot 3 shows that eruptions with a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 3 and 4 are most common in Iceland, indicating moderate explosivity is typical for Icelandic eruptions.
