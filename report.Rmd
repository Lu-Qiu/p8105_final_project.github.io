### Motivation

Recently, a striking news about the potential volcano eruption in Iceland caught our attention. Motivated by the need to better understand and analyze the impact of such natural phenomena, we aim to delve into the patterns, trends, and factors surrounding volcanic eruptions, utilizing data science techniques to extract meaningful insights.

### Initial questions

* What are the characteristics and patterns of volcanic eruptions?

* What are the main factors that influence the losses (e.g. casualties, economic damage) caused by a volcanic eruption?

### Data

We use the [Significant Volcanic Eruption Database](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/significant-volcanic-eruption-database/information/) in our study. The original csv file can be downloaded at the linked website.

The raw data is a global listing of over 800 volcanic eruptions and their information. We clean the data format, make sure the variables are appropriately encoded, correct or shorten some of the character variables' values, and select the variables of our interest. The final dataset used for the analysis has `18` variables, listed below:

* `year`: the year of eruption
* `flag_tsunami`: whether there is a tsunami accompanying the volcanic eruption
* `flag_earthquake`: whether there is an earthquake accompanying the volcanic eruption
* `volcano_name`: the name of the volcano
* `country`: the country where the volcano is located
* `elevation`: the elevation of the volcano
* `volcano_type`: the type of the volcano
* `volcanic_explosivity_index`: VEI          
* `volcano_deaths`: number of deaths caused by the eruption
* `volcano_deaths_description`: severity level of deaths
* `volcano_injuries`: number of injuries caused by the eruption                    
* `volcano_injuries_description`: severity level of injuries
* `volcano_damage_in_m`: economic damage in million caused by the eruption             
* `volcano_damage_description`: severity level of economic damage
* `volcano_houses_destroyed`: number of houses destroyed by the eruption             
* `volcano_houses_destroyed_description`: severity level of house destruction
* `lat`: latitude of the volcano                                 
* `long`: longitude of the volcano
