### Tentative Project title

Global Volcanic Eruption

### Motivation

Recently, a striking news about the volcano eruption in Iceland caught
our attention. Motivated by the need to better understand and analyze
the impact of such natural phenomena, we aim to delve into the patterns,
trends, and factors surrounding volcanic eruptions, utilizing data
science techniques to extract meaningful insights.

### Intended final products

- A website with homepage for overview of our project, a page for
  exploratory analyses, a page for statistical analyses, and a page for
  project report.
- A detailed project report.
- A two-minute narrated screencast illustrating our project.

### Data sources

- We plan to use the open data set [Significant Volcanic Eruption
  Database](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/significant-volcanic-eruption-database/table).
  The Significant Volcanic Eruption Database is a global listing of over
  500 significant eruptions which includes information on the latitude,
  longitude, elevation, type of volcano, and last known eruption. A
  significant eruption is classified as one that meets at least one of
  the following criteria: caused fatalities, caused moderate damage
  (approximately \$1 million or more), with a Volcanic Explosivity Index
  (VEI) of 6 or larger, caused a tsunami, or was associated with a major
  earthquake.

### Planned Analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

**Visualizations:**

- EDA Plots: Create plots, including at least three distinct plot types
  (e.g.Â scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, etc.).

**Analyses:**

- Hypothesis Test:
- Linear Regression: Fit a linear model

**Challenges:**

- Addressing Missing Data: Within our extensive dataset, a substantial
  number of variables exhibit missing values.
- Enhancing Variable Selection: As we strive to comprehensively examine
  aspects of stress level, depression score, anxiety score, and beyond,
  it is essential to broaden the spectrum of variables in our dataset.
- Data Quality Issues: We need to ensure the quality of the data is
  crucial. Data may contain errors, outliers, or inconsistencies that
  can lead to biased or inaccurate results.
- Website Design: We plan to create a state-of-the-art website with
  advanced features and a visually appealing design.
