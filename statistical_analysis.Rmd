## Ordered logistic regression

### Methodology



### Correlation analysis(相关性分析)


### Test effect modifier
Now we will examine the relationship between the dependent variable `volcano_deaths_description` and the interaction between `flag_earthquake` and `flag_tsunami`.
```{r}
model1 <- polr(volcano_deaths_description~flag_earthquake*flag_tsunami,data = tidy_df)
summary(model1)

ctable1 <- coef(summary(model1))

p <- pnorm(abs(ctable1[, "t value"]), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2

(ctable1 <- cbind(ctable1, "p value" = p))

```
The interaction p-value is greater than 0.05, so it's not significant. There is not enough evidence to suggest that the relationship between volcano_deaths_description and the combination of flag_earthquake and flag_tsunami is significantly different from the sum of their individual effects.Given this result, we consider using a simpler model without the interaction term.

### Fit the Ordinal Logistic Regression Model

```{r}
model2 <- polr(volcano_deaths_description ~ flag_earthquake + flag_tsunami + volcanic_explosivity_index+elevation, data = tidy_df, Hess=TRUE)

## view a summary of the model
summary(model2)
```
The estimated model can be written as:


Interprate:



Some people require a p value to be satisfied. In this situation, comparing the t-value to the conventional normal distribution using a z test is one method of computing a p-value. This is only true when there are infinite degrees of freedom, but large samples can well approximate it; as sample size drops, the sample becomes more biased. This method is simple to implement and is utilized in other software programs like Stata. We compute the p-values and then merge them back with the table after storing the coefficient table.
```{r}
## store table
ctable2 <- coef(summary(model2))

## calculate and store p values
p <- pnorm(abs(ctable2[, "t value"]), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2

## combined table
(ctable2 <- cbind(ctable2, "p value" = p))
```
Interprate:






We can also get confidence intervals for the parameter estimates.
```{r}
# default method gives profiled CIs
(ci <- confint(model2)) 

# CIs assuming normality
confint.default(model2) 
```



## odds ratios
exp(coef(model2))

## OR and CI
exp(cbind(OR = coef(model2), ci))

```
